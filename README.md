# SongWriter
Writes a simple song based on a roman numeral chord progression input

First, you need a text file that has these lines:
1. key (ex: f minor, A Major, etc)
2. time signature (ex: 4/4, 3/4, 12/8)
3. roman numerals (ex: I vi ii7 V43 I)

Then, you run SongWriter.java.

If someone has a few hours to waste, a midi export option would be really helpful :)
